      <h3>Automatic Cell Sorting Machine</h3>
      <p>The project develops an Automatic Cell Sorting Machine to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of sorting battery cells based on internal resistance. This machine addresses inconsistencies and high labor costs associated with manual sorting. It uses advanced technology to sort cells precisely, improving battery product reliability. The machine is adaptable for various battery types, particularly lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, and promises increased precision, higher throughput, cost efficiency, scalability, real-time monitoring, versatility, and energy efficiency.

      <h3>Portable Air Conditioner</h3>
      <p>The project involves designing a Portable Air Conditioner using Peltier modules to provide a compact and eco-friendly cooling solution for small spaces. The system leverages thermoelectric principles to create temperature gradients, effectively cooling the environment. Key features include efficient thermal management, low power consumption, and portability. The prototype demonstrated significant cooling, reducing internal temperatures from 35°C to around 5°C within 175 minutes, with stable performance observed after 90 minutes. The system achieved an average cooling power of 42.5W and a COP of 0.75, making it suitable for small room applications.

      <h3>Spur-Spur Gearbox</h3>
      <p>The project involves designing a Spur-Spur Gearbox for washing machines to optimize power transmission, efficiency, and durability. It includes detailed calculations for gears, shafts, keys, and bearings, and the creation of precise CAD models. The gearbox achieves optimal torque transmission, reduced noise levels, and reliable operation using high-quality materials like C45 and C35Mn75. This design represents a balanced approach to efficient and smooth power transmission in mechanical systems.

      <h3>Planetary Gearbox with Helical Gears.</h3>
      <p>MThe project involves the design and analysis of a Planetary Gearbox with Helical Gears. The gearbox features a 1.5 mm module and a two-stage reduction system, achieving a total reduction ratio of 9:1. Key aspects include determining the optimal number of teeth for the sun, planet, and ring gears, calculating gear dimensions, and selecting AISI 4130 steel for gears and shafts. The design ensures durability and reliability for high-torque applications, with suitable tapered roller bearings to handle radial and axial loads. The project provides a comprehensive approach to efficient and robust gearbox design</p>
